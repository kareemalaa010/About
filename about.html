                Uni-Net is a platform that provides multiple services at the same time; which are Social, Sessions and Study.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">
                Here we connect students with teachers and professors by mixing the idea of social (by being active on our platform making connections and uploading Academic posts and sharing knowledge to other students) and studying (by attending sessions and solving quizzes) with a certified points system that could be used later by your Educational Institute to be added to your GPA or Grades.
            </p>
            <p class="p3">
                Students compete in getting more points so they get higher rank on the platform which will give them more benefits, special badges and allow them to post more Academic and Educational contents with no limits to what type of content they post(Terms and conditions apply) so the other students could use the higher rank students’ pdfs, files or quizzes to get better and study harder.
